# WP Email Blocker

WP Email Blocker is a WordPress plugin designed to prevent users or bots from registering on your website using specific email domains or full email addresses. This plugin empowers administrators to maintain better control over who can register on their site by blocking unwanted email addresses.

## Features

- Block specific email domains (e.g., `example.com`).
- Block specific email addresses (e.g., `spam@example.com`).
- Easy-to-use interface to manage blocked emails.
- Lightweight and efficient.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zerosonesfun/wp-email-blocker).
2. Upload the plugin folder (`wp-email-blocker`) to your WordPress `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

---

## Usage

1. Go to the plugin settings page in the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Add the email domains or specific email addresses you'd like to block.
3. Save your changes. Users or bots attempting to register with blocked emails will now be prevented.

## Example

To block:
- All users with the domain `example.com`, add `example.com` to the first blocklist.
- A specific email address, add `spam@example.com` to the second blocklist.

## Contributing 

Feel free to contribute! I do want to keep this light though. It's not meant to turn into some kind of all-in-one security plugin or anything like that.
